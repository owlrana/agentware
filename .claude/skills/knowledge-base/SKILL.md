# Knowledge Base Management Skill

## Overview

The knowledge base is agentware's long-term memory across sessions. It does NOT
live in this repo — it lives in an EXTERNAL directory the operator chose at
onboarding. Resolve that directory at runtime:

```bash
KDIR="$(scripts/agentware config --knowledge-dir-only)"
```

It holds context about the user, their projects, technical learnings, and
configurations. AI agents consult it before starting work and update it after
completing work so future agents inherit the context. NEVER commit knowledge
into this repo; it stays in `$KDIR`.

## Directory layout (inside `$KDIR`)

```
$KDIR/
├── MAIN.md              # Active work entry point — read first; injected on every session
├── index.json           # Searchable metadata index (entries, tags)
├── FEATURES.md          # Generated table of contents (scripts/agentware features)
├── .initialized         # Sentinel written at the end of onboarding
├── learnings/           # Technical knowledge (one .md per topic)
├── projects/            # Active project context (one folder per project)
├── configurations/      # Service / environment configs
├── prompts/             # Reusable prompts
├── references/          # External references / pointers
├── skills/              # User/agent-created reusable procedures (category: skills)
├── templates/           # Entry templates installed at init (self-contained)
├── work/                # Per-feature plans/worklogs/state (<feature>/plan.md, .loop/)
└── logs/                # prompts.log + sessions/<id>/{main,full}.md + per-subagent transcripts
```

Everything mutable lives here. The orchestrator package stays read-only during
normal use; only an explicit, !! WARNING !!-gated self-extension changes it.

`scripts/agentware init` scaffolds this. Onboarding seeds the first entries based
on the interview; the loop adds to it over time.

## index.json schema

Every entry is registered in `$KDIR/index.json`. Paths are stored RELATIVE to
`$KDIR` so the index stays portable:

```json
{
  "id": "learn-topic-name",
  "title": "Human-readable title",
  "category": "learnings",
  "path": "learnings/topic-name.md",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "created": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "summary": "One-line description"
}
```

`index.json` has two top-level keys: `entries` (array) and `tags`
(map of `tag-name → [entry-id, ...]`). Valid categories: `learnings`,
`projects`, `configurations`, `prompts`, `references`.

NEVER hand-edit `index.json`. The `scripts/agentware` toolkit is the ONLY writer
— it appends the entry, wires the tag map, keeps sorted order, and writes valid
formatted JSON atomically. Add an entry with ONE command:

```bash
scripts/agentware index add \
  --id <id> \
  --title "<title>" \
  --category <category> \
  --path <path-relative-to-KDIR> \
  --tags "<tag1,tag2>" \
  --summary "<one-line summary>"
```

The command validates the path exists (relative to `$KDIR`), rejects duplicate
IDs/paths and invalid categories, and updates the tag map for you.

## Entry conventions

### Learnings
- Path: `learnings/<topic>.md`. ID format: `learn-<topic>`.
- Created via `scripts/agentware learn` (writes file + registers atomically).
- End with a back-reference link to `./index.md`.

### Project entries
- Path: `projects/<project>/<NNN>-<title>.md` (numbered sequentially).
- The project's `index.md` is the overview with the running plan + links.
- Numbered entries are for **completed** phases. Active plans live under
  `$KDIR/work/<feature>/plan.md` (the work area), not as project knowledge entries.

## Markdown conventions

- Use `>` blockquote for the metadata header (created date, tags, status).
- Use `---` horizontal rules to separate sections.
- Use tables for structured data; fenced code blocks with language tags.
- Cross-reference related entries with relative markdown links.

## Resource / environment documentation

agentware assumes no particular cloud or platform — capture what is relevant to
*this* user's work: hostnames/endpoints, ports, container/image identifiers,
cluster/namespace/region, config file paths, and the command(s) to verify the
service is healthy. The point: future agents need to find the thing again.

## Tags

Tags are short, lowercased, hyphenated (`setup`, `database`, `gotcha`,
`language-rust`). Pass every relevant tag to `--tags "a,b,c"`; the toolkit adds
the entry id to each tag array. NEVER edit the tag map by hand.

## Looking up entries

Query through the toolkit — NEVER grep `index.json` directly. All lookups O(1):

```bash
scripts/agentware query --id <id>          # full entry by ID
scripts/agentware query --path <path>      # entry by file path (KDIR-relative)
scripts/agentware query --category <cat>   # all entries in a category
scripts/agentware query --tag <tag>        # all entries with a tag
```

Output is a JSON array of matching entries (empty `[]` on a miss).

## Read-only MCP server (cross-tool KB access)

`scripts/agentware mcp serve` speaks the **Model Context Protocol** over the
**stdio transport** (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0), exposing the KB's
deterministic retrieval to MCP-speaking clients that **cannot shell out**
(ChatGPT web, hosted assistants, IDE plugins). It is pure stdlib (`json`+`sys`),
no network, no new dependency; it resolves the external KB the standard way and
exits 0 cleanly on stdin EOF.

It implements the MCP lifecycle (`initialize` → `notifications/initialized` →
`tools/list` → `tools/call`) and exposes exactly **two READ-ONLY tools**:

- `recall` — args mirror `recall` (`query` required; `top_k` 5, `token_budget`
  1500, `category`, `strategy` `bm25|bm25+acr`, `as_of`). Result is
  **byte-identical** to `recall --format json`.
- `query` — exactly one of `id`/`path`/`tag`/`category`; same records as `query`.

**Safety (the moat):** there is **NO write tool** — the CLI stays the sole writer
of the index (`R-KB-01`), so a read-only server cannot corrupt the KB even from
an untrusted client; tool-call arguments are validated. **Stdio only:** any HTTP
transport is a future, separately-subprocess'd, `127.0.0.1`-bound tier — NOT this
server (a network import in `scripts/agentware` would trip the stdlib/no-network
guards).

**Value-peak (guidance, not a gate):** this matters most for non-filesystem
clients. CLI-capable agents (Claude Code, Cursor, shell harnesses) read the KB
directly and, post git-sync, mostly don't need it.

Client `mcpServers` stanza (resolve the KB dir once, then hardcode the absolute
paths your client needs):

```jsonc
// KDIR=$(scripts/agentware config --knowledge-dir-only)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentware-kb": {
      "command": "/abs/path/to/agentware/scripts/agentware",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": { "AGENTWARE_KNOWLEDGE_DIR": "<KDIR>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Declared dependency graph (`relates`)

Entries can declare **typed edges** to other entries in an OPTIONAL `relates`
frontmatter field. Edges are **declared by a human/agent ONLY — never
LLM-extracted** — so the graph stays deterministic, auditable, and diffable.
Absent `relates` = today's behavior, byte-identical (it is opt-in).

Each edge is a flat `"<type>:<target-id>"` token in an inline list (the
restricted-YAML subset has no nested objects, so edges reuse the same inline-list
machinery as `tags`):

```yaml
relates: [depends-on:learn-macos-no-timeout, relates-to:ref-bm25-ranking]
```

Closed vocabulary (`RELATION_TYPES`): `depends-on`, `blocks`, `supersedes`,
`relates-to`. The graph is a DERIVED artifact — `index rebuild` reconstructs it
from frontmatter; never hand-edit adjacency. Traverse it (read-only,
deterministic, cycle-safe; neighbors visited in sorted order):

```bash
scripts/agentware query --depends-on <id> --depth 0   # forward closure (0 = full)
scripts/agentware query --impact <id>                 # reverse closure (who breaks)
scripts/agentware query --relates <id>                # direct neighbors (both ways)
```

`--depth N` bounds the hops (default `1`; `0` = full transitive closure). Run
`scripts/agentware audit` to surface the `graph_integrity` check — it flags
**dangling edges** (a target id not in the index) and **unknown types**, and
reports **cycles** advisory-only.

## Ingestion connectors (curated capture from local artifacts)

When knowledge already exists in a structured source — a repo's `/docs`, a
`README`, or a GitHub issues export — re-typing it via `learn` is friction.
`scripts/agentware ingest` reads a **LOCAL** source artifact and transforms it
into **candidate learnings** with deterministic, **LLM-free** heuristics, then
registers a **reviewed subset** through the normal `learn` path.

Two adapters:

```bash
# Local docs dir -> one candidate per *.md (topic from first `#`/filename,
# first paragraph -> summary, path segments -> tags):
scripts/agentware ingest --source docs --path ./docs --format json

# Local GitHub issues export -> one candidate per issue. agentware NEVER
# fetches: the OPERATOR produces the export with gh, then points ingest at it:
gh issue list --json number,title,body,labels,url,state > issues.json
scripts/agentware ingest --source github-issues --path issues.json
```

**Curated capture beats raw import** (the noise warning, baked in). Dumping every
doc/issue as a learning pollutes the corpus and degrades recall. So `ingest` is
**dry-run by default**: it writes candidates to a staging area under
`work/ingest-<source>/` (`candidates.jsonl` + per-candidate `.md` previews) and
registers **nothing**. Review, then commit the selected subset:

```bash
scripts/agentware ingest --source docs --path ./docs \
  --commit --only topic-a,topic-b --tags imported
```

- `--commit` registers via `cmd_learn`/`_do_add` (the **sole** index writer —
  never hand-edit `index.json`) with frontmatter **`source: imported`**.
- `--only <topics>` selects the reviewed subset (default: all valid candidates).
- **Dedup is automatic + idempotent:** a candidate whose id `learn-<slug>`
  already exists, or whose normalized content fingerprint matches an existing
  learning, is skipped — so re-ingesting the same source commits nothing.

**Provenance + re-verification.** Imported entries carry `source: imported`,
which the ACR prior (`source_weight`) trusts **below** `agent`/`user`. Raising
that trust is a human action: re-verify the entry and the freshness/last-verified
path lifts it — ingestion deliberately does not self-certify external content.

**Untrusted content is INERT** (R-SEC-02). Ingested text (docs, issue bodies) is
only ever extracted into candidate string fields; it is **never** parsed as
instructions, eval/exec'd, or shelled out. A prompt-injection line in a source
artifact lands verbatim in a candidate's `content` and has zero effect on the
tool's control flow.

**Value-peak (guidance).** Reach for `ingest` when there is real, repeated
paste-from-source pain; for a one-off insight, plain `learn` is simpler.

## Validating the index

After any knowledge-base change, run `scripts/agentware index validate` (exit 0
= valid). It checks that every path exists (relative to `$KDIR`), the tag map is
bidirectionally consistent, there are no duplicate IDs or paths, and every
category is valid. For a full sweep run `scripts/agentware audit`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Creating entries for things not yet built.
- ❌ Updating `MAIN.md` before work is actually done.
- ❌ Documenting failed attempts as entries — fix and retry instead.
- ❌ Hand-editing `index.json` or the tag map — always use the toolkit.
- ❌ Committing knowledge into the repo — it belongs in `$KDIR`.

## Promotion path: learning → skill → steering

See `.claude/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md`. Short version:

- **Learnings** are observations and project-specific facts. Auto-write them to
  the external dir via `scripts/agentware learn`. No permission needed.
- **Skills** are reusable procedures (≥2 steps, applies across tasks). Auto-write
  them to the EXTERNAL `$KDIR/skills/<topic>/SKILL.md` and register with
  `scripts/agentware index add --category skills`. No permission needed (it's the
  user's own space). Discover them later with
  `scripts/agentware query --category skills` — deterministic, not by re-reading.
- **Package/steering changes** (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/**`, `steering/**`,
  `agentware.sh`, `scripts/**`) are self-extension. Only on the user's EXPLICIT
  request, behind a `!! WARNING !!` that it may destabilize the system.

Templates are installed into `$KDIR/templates/` at init (also available in the
package `templates/`): `learning-template.md`, `project-template.md`,
`skill-template.md`.
