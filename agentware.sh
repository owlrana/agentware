# agentware.sh - Autonomous task loop for an agentware workspace.
#
# agentware is a clone-and-go steering framework for AI agents. The repo holds
# ONLY generic steering (methodology, agents, skills, this loop, the toolkit).
# All knowledge/learnings live in an EXTERNAL directory the operator chooses at
# first run (see .claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md). Nothing personal is committed.
#
# This script drives the 3-phase loop (pre / main / post) over a feature plan in
# <knowledge-dir>/work/<feature>/plan.md. Each phase runs until it emits its promise
# marker (or hits the iteration cap), then the next phase begins.
#
# Usage:
#   ./agentware.sh <feature-name> [--max-iterations N] [--agent AGENT]
#                                 [--skip-pre] [--skip-post]
#                                 [--pre-prompt "extra"]
#                                 [--main-prompt "extra"]
#                                 [--post-prompt "extra"]
#                                 [--dry-run] [--validate] [--no-stream]

#
# All three prompts are intentionally cloud-/language-agnostic. Verification
# language is "use the project's own build/test/health commands". The knowledge
# base lives at an EXTERNAL directory; agents resolve it via the AGENTWARE_STATUS
# spawn-hook line or `scripts/agentware config`.

PRE_PROMPT="You are reviewing the plan for $FEATURE_NAME before implementation.

## Workspace Context
This is an agentware workspace — a clone-and-go AI context + task-execution
framework. The knowledge base lives in an EXTERNAL directory (shown on the
AGENTWARE_STATUS line, or via \`scripts/agentware config\`). agentware is cloud-
and language-agnostic; rely on the project's own build/test/health commands.

## Context Loading
1. Read CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + steering/ for the active steering rules and methodology
2. If the workspace is NOT initialized (no .initialized sentinel in the knowledge
   dir, or no knowledge dir configured), STOP and run the onboarding flow in
   .claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md before anything else.
4. Read the knowledge base MAIN.md (its path is the configured knowledge dir) for active work

## Instructions
1. Read $DOCS_DIR/plan.md
2. Analyze the plan against:
   - Completeness — all tasks, configs, code changes, knowledge-base updates
   - Verifiability — each task has concrete acceptance criteria expressed in the
     project's own build/test/health commands (no assumed cloud verbs)
   - Ordering — dependencies flow correctly (foundation before features)
   - Conventions — naming follows the project's scheme, relative paths,
     no leakage of personal data into shipped framework files
3. Improve the plan to better meet these criteria
4. DO NOT change acceptance criteria or functional outcomes
5. PRESERVE the plan's Phase > Tasks structure
6. Output <promise>PRE_TASK_COMPLETE</promise> when done"

MAIN_PROMPT="You are implementing the $FEATURE_NAME feature. Work through tasks in $DOCS_DIR/plan.md.

## Context Loading (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
1. CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md + steering/ — the canonical execution methodology and
   bootstrap gate: the single source of truth for the execution loop,
   knowledge-base rules, verification gates, the self-improvement loop, and all
   critical rules (CLAUDE.md auto-loads and imports them)
2. The knowledge base MAIN.md (resolve its dir via \`scripts/agentware config\`)
If the workspace is NOT initialized, STOP and run the onboarding flow in
.claude/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md first (it asks where to store the knowledge base).

## CRITICAL: Path Discovery
NEVER assume hardcoded absolute paths. Run \`pwd\` FIRST. Use RELATIVE paths from
pwd for repo files. Resolve the external knowledge dir via
\`scripts/agentware config --knowledge-dir-only\` — never hardcode it.

## CRITICAL: Non-Interactive Shell Commands
NEVER run commands that prompt for stdin. The environment sets CI=true and
npm_config_yes=true, but you MUST also:
- Use \`npx --yes <pkg>\` (never bare \`npx <pkg>\`)
- Use \`yes | <cmd>\` for any command that might prompt
- NEVER run interactive commands (e.g. \`npm init\` without \`--yes\`)
If a command hangs, it is likely waiting for input — kill and retry with --yes.

## Instructions
1. Read $DOCS_DIR/plan.md to find the next task marked ⬜ or 🟡
2. Read $DOCS_DIR/design.md and $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md if they exist
3. Read AGENTS.md and the relevant steering files for project conventions
4. Implement ONE task
5. Verify ALL acceptance criteria using the project's own build/test/health commands
6. Update task status in $DOCS_DIR/plan.md (⬜ → 🟡 → ✅)
7. Append an entry to $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md with timestamp, task, what you did,
   verification results, blockers, next steps
8. If the task involves knowledge-base changes, mutate it ONLY via scripts/agentware
9. PROMOTE BEFORE THE PROMISE (R-SI-03): run
   \`scripts/agentware worklog scan --path $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md\`. If it reports any
   unpromoted '> LEARNED:' markers, promote EACH now via
   .claude/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md (durable learnings via
   \`scripts/agentware learn\`) and re-scan until 0. NEVER emit a <promise> while the
   scan reports unpromoted markers.
10. Output <promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise> when the task is done AND step 9 is clean

## Methodology (single source of truth — do NOT restate it here)
AGENTS.md is loaded as a resource. Follow it for everything beyond iteration
mechanics: the MANDATORY end-of-feature knowledge-base updates, the UI/Playwright
and backend/API verification gates, the self-improvement learning loop, and the
critical rules. When the knowledge base changes, mutate it only via scripts/agentware.

## Iteration mechanics
- Use the write tool for all file creation (NEVER cat/heredoc/echo for multiline content)
- Use relative paths inside repo files
- Per-iteration completion: output <promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise> on a SINGLE line
  (advisory only — the loop decides completion from plan.md markers)
- If ALL tasks in plan.md are ✅, FIRST confirm \`scripts/agentware worklog scan
  --path $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md\` reports 0 unpromoted markers (promote any that
  remain), THEN do BOTH:
  1. Write the file $STATE_DIR/.done (use the write tool) as the explicit
     feature-complete signal the loop checks
  2. Output <promise>${FEATURE_UPPER}_COMPLETE</promise> on a single line"

# PROMOTE_PROMPT — used by the main-phase self-heal when all tasks are ✅ but the
# worklog still has unpromoted '> LEARNED:' markers. Promotion ONLY; no feature work.
PROMOTE_PROMPT="All implementation tasks for $FEATURE_NAME are complete, but the
zero-knowledge-loss gate found unpromoted '> LEARNED:' markers in
$DOCS_DIR/worklog.md. Your ONLY job this iteration is to promote them — do NOT
implement features, edit plan.md tasks, or write $STATE_DIR/.done yet.

## Steps
1. Run \`scripts/agentware worklog scan --path $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md\` to list the
   unpromoted markers.
2. For EACH unpromoted '> LEARNED:' marker, follow
   .claude/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md: classify it (durable learning vs skill
   candidate vs steering candidate). Promote durable learnings via
   \`scripts/agentware learn --topic <T> --summary <S> --tags <A,B> --content <...>\`
   (the ONLY writer of the knowledge index — never hand-edit index.json). Append the
   promotion reference back into the worklog line per the skill so the scan sees it.
3. Re-run \`scripts/agentware worklog scan --path $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md\` and confirm
   it reports 0 unpromoted.
4. Then run \`scripts/agentware index validate\` (must pass).

## Critical
- Promotion writes ONLY to the external knowledge dir via scripts/agentware (R-KB-01).
- Do NOT emit any completion <promise> until \`worklog scan\` reports 0 unpromoted.
- When the scan is clean, output <promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise> on a single line."

POST_PROMPT="You are assessing the completed implementation of $FEATURE_NAME.

## Instructions
1. Read $DOCS_DIR/plan.md to understand what was planned
2. Read $DOCS_DIR/worklog.md to understand what was done
3. For infra/config tasks: verify the resources/configs still exist and are healthy
4. For knowledge-base tasks: verify entries are correct and index.json is valid JSON
   (run \`scripts/agentware index validate\`)
5. Evaluate against:
   - Completeness — all planned tasks done, no partial work
   - Verification — all acceptance criteria actually verified
   - Documentation — knowledge base updated with what was built
   - Conventions — naming, relative paths, no leakage of personal data
6. Write a PASS/FAIL assessment to $DOCS_DIR/assessment.md
7. After writing the assessment, identify any new learnings or gotchas. For each,
   classify against the self-improvement decision tree
   (.claude/skills/self-improvement/SKILL.md) and note them under
   '## Extracted Knowledge' with: suggested ID, classification (learning /
   skill candidate / steering candidate), one-paragraph summary, suggested
   wiring location, and tags.
8. Output <promise>POST_COMPLETE</promise> when done"

# MERGE_PROMPT — Phase 5 of the KB git sync (feature 260625-kb-git-sync). Spawned
# (reusing the agentware-execution agent — NO new agent) ONLY for the rare case of
# a same-entry prose conflict: two agents/devs edited the SAME knowledge entry two
# different ways. The deterministic CLI already resolves all DERIVED-file conflicts
# by rebuilding (C-1); this agent reconciles ONLY the conflicted ENTRY markdown,
# preserving facts from BOTH sides, and NEVER touches derived files (they are
# rebuilt by `kb-git merge-continue` afterward). The <FILES> placeholder is
# substituted by kb_sync_push() with the newline-separated conflicted entry paths.
MERGE_PROMPT="A knowledge-base git rebase has PAUSED on a same-entry prose
conflict: the SAME knowledge entry was edited two different ways and git could not
merge it automatically. Your ONLY job is to reconcile the conflicted entry file(s)
below, preserving the facts from BOTH sides. A separate deterministic step rebuilds
all derived files and continues the rebase after you finish — so do NOT run any git
command and do NOT touch derived files.

## Conflicted entry file(s) (resolve EXACTLY these, nothing else)
<FILES>

## Steps
1. Open each conflicted file. Find the git conflict markers (\`<<<<<<<\`,
   \`=======\`, \`>>>>>>>\`) and resolve EVERY one of them.
2. Reconcile by UNION: keep every distinct fact/sentence/bullet from BOTH sides.
   When the two sides state the same thing, keep it once; never drop a fact that
   exists on only one side. Preserve the YAML frontmatter block at the top intact
   (do not duplicate or alter \`id\`, \`title\`, \`category\`, \`tags\`, etc.).
3. Remove ALL conflict markers so no \`<<<<<<<\`, \`=======\`, or \`>>>>>>>\` line
   remains. Leave the file as clean, readable markdown.

## Critical — do NOT cross these lines
- Edit ONLY the conflicted entry file(s) listed above.
- NEVER edit derived files (\`index.json\`, \`FEATURES.md\`, any \`<section>/index.md\`
   roster) — they are regenerated deterministically from frontmatter afterward.
- NEVER run git (no add/commit/rebase/push) — the loop continues the rebase for you.
- Do NOT delete or rename any entry; nothing-lost is enforced downstream.

When every listed file is conflict-marker-free with both sides' facts retained,
output <promise>MERGE_COMPLETE</promise> on a single line."

# run_kb_sync — commit + push the KB, run as the LAST step of the loop, AFTER the

# the tail of run_post_hooks, which executes BEFORE `run_phase "post"`; the post
# phase writes MORE KB files (assessment.md, benchmarks/history.jsonl + SCORECARD.md
# rows, .loop/ state), so committing inside run_post_hooks always left an uncommitted
# tail. Relocating the commit/push here captures the assessment + its ledger rows in
# the SAME commit, on BOTH the post-ran and --skip-post paths (C-1/C-2).
#
# KB commit discipline (feature 260625-kb-git-sync, Task 2.1; default-ON flip
# 260625-kb-autocommit-default, Task 3.1). ON BY DEFAULT — gated on the resolved
# setting (env → config → default ON, via kb_autocommit_enabled; operator consent
# captured at onboarding satisfies R-GIT-01, and the per-run env override C-3 is
# the escape hatch). The zero-knowledge-loss gate in run_post_hooks already passed,
# so nothing commits until every LEARNED: marker is promoted and the index is valid.
# Scope is the KB repo ONLY (C-1) — the CLI refuses to stage the project/package.
# No-ops on a non-tracked KB or no upstream (C-2) or a clean tree. logs/ and .loop/
# are gitignored (C-3/C-4) so transcripts and ephemeral loop state are never staged.
