# The agentware loop

The loop is the runtime of an agentware workspace. It implements features
iteratively from structured plans. It reads a `plan.md`, works through tasks one
iteration at a time, verifies each step against the project's own checks, and
updates a worklog as it goes. The runner is `agentware.sh`.

## Three Phases

`agentware.sh` runs three phases automatically:

1. **Pre-phase** (3 tasks max). Analyze and improve the plan against the
   project's steering rules and knowledge-base conventions. Cannot change
   acceptance criteria or functional outcomes — only sharpen wording, add missing
   verifications, and reorder dependencies.

2. **Main phase** (N iterations, capped by `--max-iterations`). Execute the plan
   task by task. Tasks may span infrastructure, code, configuration, and
   knowledge-base updates. Each iteration verifies its own work using the
   project's own build / test / health commands.

3. **Post-phase** (1 task). Assess the completed work. Reviews the worklog and
   results, producing a PASS / FAIL report. Writes to `assessment.md`.

```bash
# Fire and forget — runs all three phases.
./agentware.sh my-feature

# Skip phases if needed.
./agentware.sh my-feature --skip-pre    # plan already reviewed
./agentware.sh my-feature --skip-post   # skip assessment

# Cap iterations or override the agent / preview without spawning.
./agentware.sh my-feature --max-iterations 30
./agentware.sh my-feature --dry-run

# Inject extra prompt fragments.
./agentware.sh my-feature --main-prompt "Use the dev environment, not prod."
```

By default the loop spawns Claude Code headlessly
(`claude -p --agent agentware-execution --dangerously-skip-permissions`). Set
`AGENTWARE_CLI=<your-cli>` to use a different runtime, and `AGENTWARE_MODEL` to
override the model.

## Why iterations?

The primary goal is to **prevent context rot**. LLMs accumulate errors and drift
from intent as context grows. By breaking work into iterations with fresh
context, each iteration starts clean with only the plan and the worklog as
carry-over.

The iteration boundary is about **logical completeness**, not complexity limits.
One task can span multiple commands; what matters is that the task finishes
verifiable before the next iteration begins.

## Knowledge is external

agentware ships with no knowledge base. The operator's knowledge lives in a
directory chosen at onboarding, resolved at runtime via
`scripts/agentware config --knowledge-dir-only`. Nothing personal is committed to
this repo. The deterministic toolkit (`scripts/agentware`) is the only writer of
structured knowledge data.

Work artifacts and logs are external too: each feature's plan/worklog/state lives
in `<knowledge-dir>/work/<feature>/`, and `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop`
hooks record every prompt + full session transcript to `<knowledge-dir>/logs/`.
The orchestrator package stays read-only across projects.

## Multi-domain tasks

- **Infrastructure**: any environment the user manages (containers, VMs, cloud,
  on-prem). agentware does not assume which.
- **Code**: changes to the user's source code, in any language.
- **Configuration**: configs the user deploys to running services.
- **Knowledge capture**: documenting learnings, resource references, project context.

**Priorities (in order):**
1. Working code / completed tasks.
2. Verified results — the project's own checks pass.
3. Knowledge base updated with what was built and any new learnings.
4. No partial implementations or TODOs left behind.

## Creating work for the loop

Each feature gets a subdirectory in the EXTERNAL knowledge dir:

```
<knowledge-dir>/work/<YYMMDD-feature-name>/
├── design.md         # Feature design document (optional)
├── plan.md           # Implementation plan
├── .loop/
│   └── .iteration    # Current iteration number (managed by agentware.sh)
└── worklog.md        # Progress notes (created during the main phase)
```

## Writing effective plans

A good plan tells the loop **what** to build and **when it's done**. The agent
figures out implementation details.

### Three layers

1. **Context** — background, references to relevant knowledge-base entries,
   workspace info, dependencies on other plans.
2. **Tasks** — concrete deliverables.
3. **Acceptance Criteria** — verifiable conditions stated in the project's own
   commands (file exists, test passes, health endpoint returns 200, etc.).

### Task format

```markdown
## Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation

- ⬜ **1.1** Set up the local development database
  - Postgres 16 reachable on `localhost:5432`
  - Schema migrated via `./scripts/migrate.sh`
  - Verify with `psql -c '\dt'` returning the expected tables

- ⬜ **1.2** Configure the application config file
  - `config/local.yaml` written with the database URL
  - `npm run start` boots without errors

### Phase 2: Knowledge base update

- ⬜ **2.1** Document the new local-dev setup in the knowledge base
  - New entry created under `projects/<project>/` (in the external knowledge dir)
  - `index.json` updated via `scripts/agentware index add`
  - `MAIN.md` updated with a brief active-work line
```

## Agent steering & rules

For execution methodology, knowledge-base rules, commit behavior, and naming
conventions, refer to `AGENTS.md` at the root — the single, canonical,
always-loaded methodology (Deterministic Steering Format). Human-facing rationale
and worked examples live in `docs/methodology.md` (not agent-loaded).
