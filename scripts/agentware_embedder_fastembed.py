"""Real pinned LOCAL embedder backend for agentware Mode B (semantic retrieval).

Feature 260627-semantic-embedding-settings. This delivers the ONE missing piece
of the prior 260625-semantic-retrieval-benchmark roadmap: a real, on-device
embedding model behind the existing `load_embedder` contract. It uses
`fastembed` (ONNX runtime, NO PyTorch, Python>=3.10) so embeddings are computed
fully on the operator's own machine after a one-time model download — no hosted
API, no cloud, no data leaves the host (the moat's "local only" line).

OPTIONAL + lazily loaded, exactly like the reference `agentware_embedder_ollama`:
the `scripts/agentware` toolkit NEVER imports this file (or `fastembed`)
statically. It is loaded via importlib ONLY when the operator points
`AGENTWARE_EMBEDDER_BACKEND` here, so the toolkit's static-import surface stays
stdlib-only (C-dep guard / INV-6) and Mode A (pure BM25, zero-install) runs with
nothing installed. `fastembed` is imported LAZILY inside this module's methods,
never at module top level, so even loading this file by importlib does not require
`fastembed` to be present until an embed actually happens.

Pinned dependency (R-DEP-02): `fastembed==0.8.0`. Install (operator-approved):

    python3 -m pip install fastembed==0.8.0

Default model `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (384-dim, fast); opt up to
`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768-dim) via `AGENTWARE_EMBED_MODEL` / `config
--set-embed-model`. The model id is a pinned HuggingFace id; fastembed downloads
only model weights + tokenizer (ONNX) — NO code execution from model files
(R-SEC-02).

Contract expected by `load_embedder()`:

    get_embedder(model=None) -> Embedder
    Embedder.embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]   # fixed-dim
    Embedder.dim: int

Determinism (INV-1, Mode B): a pinned model returns the SAME vector for the SAME
input ON A GIVEN MACHINE. Every component is ROUNDED to a fixed precision
(`EMBED_ROUND_DP`, mirroring the Ollama backend) so serialization jitter can
never perturb the downstream cosine ranking; RRF later fuses on INTEGER ranks, so
Mode B is deterministic GIVEN a pinned model + cached vectors. Reproducibility is
pinned to the model version + machine, stated honestly: ONNX float math can
differ ACROSS machines/CPUs, so the vector cache + benchmark numbers are
reproduced PER MACHINE — never claimed to be unconditionally cross-machine
byte-identical (unlike Mode A's pure-stdlib BM25, which IS unconditional).
